            <h1>KYC Process, Data Collection and Retention</h1>
            <section>
                <p>As part of the NIM Activation, Nimiq Network Ltd. ("Nimiq") conducts a KYC Procedure to help ensure
                    regulatory compliance and adapt Genesis Block NIM to international standards. Since data protection
                    is of a particularly high priority for us, we would like to inform you of the exact nature, scope,
                    and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process.</p>

                <p>All personal data gathered by Nimiq during the KYC Procedure ("Personal Information") will only be
                    used to identify and verify your identity. As part of the KYC Procedure, Nimiq will collaborate with
                    Intrum Justitia AG, Eschenstrasse 12, CH-8603 Schwerzenbach, Switzerland; Jumio Corporation, 268
                    Lambert Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94306, US; and IVXS Technology USA Ltd, 85 Broad St, NY 10004, US
                    ("ComplyAdvantage") (collectively "Service Providers"). All Service Providers have provided
                    sufficient guarantees to meet all applicable regulatory requirements and will only process your
                    Personal Information on servers situated within the European Union (for further reference see <a
                            href="https://www.jumio.com/legal-information/privacy-policy/jumio-inc-privacy-policy-for-online-services/"
                            target="_blank">Jumio Data Privacy Policy</a> and <a
                            href="https://go.online-ident.ch/privacy/en" target="_blank">Intrum Data Privacy Policy</a>).
                </p>

                <p>Nimiq will transfer your Personal Information to either Intrum Justitia or Jumio. They will be
                    responsible for the identification and verification of your identity and will ask you to provide a
                    photograph or videofeed of your passport and face ("Verification Information"). After their
                    verification Procedure, Intrum Justitia or Jumio will provide to Nimiq a copy of the Verification
                    Information and will retain the Personal Information and the Verification Information for a period
                    of 180 days (Intrum Justitia) or 12 months (Jumio), respectively.</p>

                <p>If the verification Procedure is successful, Nimiq will then send your full name and birth date to
                    ComplyAdvantage to perform a Sanctions & Watchlist Check. ComplyAdvantage will be responsible for
                    conducting the sanctionlist- / embargo- and PEP-check and Nimiq will use that information to ensure
                    that you are not prohibited from participating in the NIM Activation. ComplyAdvantage will not
                    retain any of the Personal Information obtained by Nimiq.</p>

                <p>After passing the Sanctions & Watchlist Check, you will receive from Nimiq an acceptance email
                    containing detailed instructions on how to activate your NIM.The Personal Information and
                    Verification Information will then be encrypted by Nimiq and stored with ISO 27001 certified hosts
                    in Germany or Switzerland for a period of up to 10 years. This allows Nimiq to demonstrate to
                    regulators that the KYC Procedure was implemented. Nimiq will delete all non-encrypted data within
                    48 hours after sending the acceptance email.</p>

                <p>If you want to learn more about your rights with regard to your Personal Information, please take a
                    look at our <a href="https://www.nimiq.com/privacy">Website Privacy Policy</a> and consult with your
                    personal advisors.</p>
