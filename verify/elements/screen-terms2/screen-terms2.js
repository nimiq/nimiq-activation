<p class=Randziffer><span lang=EN-US>As part of the NIM Activation, Nimiq
Network Ltd. (“Nimiq”) conducts a KYC Process to help ensure regulatory
compliance and adapt Genesis Block NIM to international standards. Since data
protection is of a particularly high priority for us, we would like to inform you
of the exact nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use
and process.</span></p>

<p class=Randziffer><span lang=EN-US>All personal data gathered by Nimiq during
the KYC Process (“Personal Information”) will only be used to identify and
verify your identity. As part of the KYC Process, Nimiq will collaborate with <b

<p class=Randziffer><span lang=EN-US>Nimiq will transfer your Personal Information

After their verification process, Intrum Justitia or Jumio will provide to
Nimiq a copy of the Verification Information and will retain the Personal

Justitia) or 12 months (Jumio), respectively.</span></p>

<p class=Randziffer><span lang=EN-US>If the verification process is successful,
Nimiq will then send your full name and birth date to ComplyAdvantage to
perform a Sanctions &amp; Watchlist Check. ComplyAdvantage will be responsible

that information to ensure that you are not prohibited from participating in
the NIM Activation. ComplyAdvantage will not retain any of the Personal
Information obtained by Nimiq.</span></p>

<p class=Randziffer><span lang=EN-US>After passing the Sanctions &amp;
Watchlist Check, you will receive from Nimiq an acceptance email containing
detailed instructions on how to activate your NIM. The Personal Information and
Verification Information will then be encrypted by Nimiq and stored on ISO 27001
certified servers in Germany or Switzerland for a period of up to 10 years. This
allows Nimiq to demonstrate to regulators that the KYC Process was implemented.
Nimiq will delete all non-encrypted data within 48 hours after sending the acceptance
email.</span></p>
